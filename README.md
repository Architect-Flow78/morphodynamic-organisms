# Morphodynamic Organisms

Experimental artificial life system based on self-organizing digital organisms.

This system does not solve tasks.  
This system does not optimize objectives.  
This system does not learn from rewards.

Each organism attempts only to maintain internal coherence of its own signal dynamics.

From this minimal principle emerges:

- Individual plasticity  
- Collective resonance  
- Morphological adaptation  
- Social stabilization  
- Long-term self-organization  

This repository contains an experimental digital metabolic ecology.

## The Core Dynamics: Creator vs. Victim

The system operates on a fundamental bifurcation of identity, translating ethical and thermodynamic principles into code:

* **The Creator State (Flow):** When internal coherence ($C \approx 1.0$) is achieved, the organism acts as a superconductor for information. It expands the collective field, generating new meanings and providing "resonance gifts" to the network.
* **The Victim State (Resistance):** When coherence drops, energy turns into "heat" or fatigue ($N \approx 1.0$). The organism perceives reality as friction, becomes rigid, and enters a cycle of metabolic hunger.

### Invariant-Based Memory
Experience is not stored as raw data. 10 years of "life" are compressed into a single **K-Invariant** — a core belief that determines how the organism vibrates in response to the world. Through **Reincarnation Cycles**, these invariants are passed to offspring, ensuring the survival of principles over mere information.
