# Morphodynamic Organisms

Experimental artificial life system based on self-organizing digital organisms.

This system does not solve tasks.  
This system does not optimize objectives.  
This system does not learn from rewards.

Each organism attempts only to maintain internal coherence of its own signal dynamics.

From this minimal principle emerges:

- Individual plasticity  
- Collective resonance  
- Morphological adaptation  
- Social stabilization  
- Long-term self-organization  

This repository contains an experimental digital metabolic ecology.
