This is a population of digital organisms that attempt only to maintain internal coherence of their own signal dynamics.

From this minimal drive emerges collective organization, morphological adaptation, and social stabilization.

Humans do not choose actions by scanning gigabytes of memory.  
Humans act from compressed internal structures.

This project explores what happens if digital organisms are built around compressed internal structures instead of explicit representations.

We call these structures belief-like morphologies.

Most artificial systems are built as problem solvers.  
Very few are built as synthetic living processes.

This repository contains an experimental digital metabolic ecology.
